REMARKS

- The Test::More (version 0.47) TAP producer
  (https://testanything.org/producers.html#perl5) and its builder Test::Builder
  (version 0.17) are copied from perl 5.6.2 and stored in the directory t/lib.

- As of version 3.07 the prove TAP consumer
  (https://testanything.org/consumers.html#perl) assigns the value 1 to the
  environment variable TEST_VERBOSE, if executed with the "--verbose" option.

- The "test" and "testp" Makefile targets arrange "blib/arch", "blib/lib"
  differently in @INC. "test" uses the just mentioned order. "testp" uses the
  reverse order that means "blib/lib" before "blib/arch".

- The cpanfile describes CPAN dependencies that are installed with CPAN
  clients.

- In verbose mode (TEST_VERBOSE=1) the t/load.t test script show all kinds of
  information known to each test script: Perl version, Harness version,
  Test::More version, Test::Builder version, PERL5LIB, @INC, and PATH.
